          <h1>The 2017 Collaboration Prize: Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
          <p>We recommend that you carefully review the eligibility criteria for the 2017 Prize and the answers to these frequently asked questions prior to applying.  </p>

          <h2>About the Prize</h2>

          <p><strong>Q: What is The Collaboration Prize?</strong></p>
<p>A: The Collaboration Prize is a national award presented to outstanding nonprofits that collaborate effectively to create greater impact. </p>

<p><strong>Q:  What type of award will be made?</strong></p>
<p>A:  A grand prize of $150,000 will be awarded to the collaboration that best exemplifies the impact that can result from working together on a permanent basis.  In addition, each of the eight finalists will receive $10,000. </p>

<p><strong>Q:  Are there any requirements regarding the use of the Prize awards?</strong></p>
<p>Although The Collaboration Prize money must be used for charitable purposes, there are no specific requirements on its use. The Collaboration Prize planners hope that the funds will be used to enhance the winning collaborations’ continued contributions to the social good.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How is the monetary award divided up among organizations participating in a winning collaboration?</strong></p>
<p>A: There are no restrictions on how the money is to be divided among organizations participating in the winning collaboration. It is the responsibility of participating organizations to divide winnings in a fair and equitable manner.</p>

<p><strong>Q Who funds the Collaboration Prize?</strong></p>
<p>A: The Collaboration Prize is the brainchild of The Lodestar Foundation, a Phoenix-based philanthropic organization. Lodestar is currently the sole funder of The Collaboration Prize. </p>

<p><strong>Q: Why was the Collaboration Prize developed?</strong></p>
<p>A: The Collaboration Prize is designed to identify and showcase models of collaboration among nonprofit organizations. Recognizing the impact that can result from working together, the Prize shines a spotlight on permanent collaborations among two or more nonprofit organizations that cooperate to achieve innovative and effective responses to challenges or opportunities. </p>

<p>The Prize is evidence of The Lodestar Foundation’s commitment to its mission: maximizing the growth and impact of philanthropy. This mission is fulfilled, in part, by supporting organizations that increase impact and efficiency through working together. In support of this mission, Lodestar created The Collaboration Prize to identify achievements in collaboration as models for inspiration and replication.</p>

<p>The Prize also seeks to build an extensive and comprehensive information base of effective practice models that can be studied and used by academics, nonprofit leaders and grantmakers to inspire and advance their work.  </p>

<p><strong>Q: What is the Nonprofit Collaboration database?</strong></p>
<p>A: The database exemplifies the Prize’s mission to provide models and best practices for the field. It is a resource for everyone seeking real-life examples of how nonprofit organizations are working together. The database currently contains detailed information on over 650 collaborations and will be further expanded to include new collaboration models resulting from the 2017 Prize process. Information is arranged by searchable categories, including ways to collaborate, reasons to collaborate, challenges and outcomes. </p>

<p>The database is housed in the Collaboration Hub (webpage?) at the Foundation Center, a national nonprofit service organization that connects nonprofits and grantmakers to tools, resources and information. </p>
